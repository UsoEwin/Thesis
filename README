last update time: March 14 //please modify this whenever you want to push a update

done:

	unit computing module for line-length
	unit computing module for power spectrum
	unit computing module for non-linear energy
	tb for synch fifo
	tb for linelength computing unit
	tb for ps unit
	tb for ne unit //functionality test done
    unit accu 
    tb for unit accu //now instead of using FIFO, we will just use a shift reg
    shift regs
todo:
	
	testbench for IIR filter

	shift regs
	
	testbench for 3 unit computing modules(use isim instead of eda playground, modules means we need to combine the unit with FIFO)

	testbench overall system(read in the test dataflow and gain a output on software)

    interfacing -- at least light up some LEDs
    

Chen: 	tb updated, can be used by all modules.
	Remember to change DUT name to corresponding module when using it!

Jingbo: splited 3 diff unit tb, IIR filter added.
